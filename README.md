# Bio_Facility_Automation
The current designs of bioprocess and biomanufacturing require excessive labour and manual interventions. The bio-manufacturing industry devotes 35-50% of total cost in labour, the highest among all, compared to 10-14% in the next highest industry. Besides economical reasons, there exists safety reasons to implement automation in the bio facilities especially in the wake of recent Covid-19 like situations where minimal contact is of paramount importance and the medical staff are in shortage. The proposed idea is to develop a robotic system composed of a mobile robot and manipulator arm capable of transporting material within the facility and performing the procedural tasks using the manipulator.

The goal of this project is to program a robot than can autonomously map an environment and navigate to pick up and drop off virtual objects. List of the steps in this project :

* Design a simple environment with the Building Editor in Gazebo.
* Teleoperate your robot and manually test SLAM.
* Create a wall_follower node that autonomously drives your robot to map the environment.
* Use the ROS navigation stack and manually commands your robot using the 2D Nav Goal arrow in rviz to move to 2 different desired positions and orientations.
* Write a pick_objects node that commands your robot to move to the desired pickup and drop off zones.
* Write an add_markers node that subscribes to your robot odometry, keeps track of your robot pose, and publishes markers to rviz.
* The new robot and world are another set of robots and worlds which can be implemented by replacing every Ishan.world and my_robot.xacro with the files by the same name in the directories.

## Project setup 

Update system:
`sudo apt-get update`

Install the ROS navigation stack:
`sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation`

Create catkin workspace:
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```
Clone the following repositories to catkin_ws/src:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ https://github.com/nigamishan/Bio_Facility_Automation.git
```
Install package dependencies with `rosdep install [package-name]`

Copy content of this repository to catkin_ws/src

Catkin workspace should look something like this:
```

Source and build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ catkin_make
```
Run `./home_service.sh` in `ShellScripts` directory to deploy the home service robot.
