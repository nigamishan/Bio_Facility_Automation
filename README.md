# Bio_Facility_Automation
The current designs of bioprocess and biomanufacturing require excessive labour and manual interventions. The bio-manufacturing industry devotes 35-50% of total cost in labour, the highest among all, compared to 10-14% in the next highest industry. Besides economical reasons, there exists safety reasons to implement automation in the bio facilities especially in the wake of recent Covid-19 like situations where minimal contact is of paramount importance and the medical staff are in shortage. The proposed idea is to develop a robotic system composed of a mobile robot and manipulator arm capable of transporting material within the facility and performing the procedural tasks using the manipulator.
